### Install

After having installed `inductiva` package with pip, the next step is to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva-sph-demos.git
```

Then, for analysis of the results we suggest the installation of a few extra dependencies from within the `inductiva-sph-demos`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run visualizations you may be required to install `ffmpeg`, if it is not already installed in your setup. You can download it from
[here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), or if using Anaconda to manage the environment install it directly with `conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg`.
