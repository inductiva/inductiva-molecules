With [**Inductiva API**](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/tree/main) exploring Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations was never easier. Users can launch the simulations they are familiar with through a simple Python interface. 

Two open-source SPH simulators are available via **Inductiva API** - [SplishSplash](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/wiki/SPlisHSPlasH) and [DualSPHysics](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/wiki/DualSPHysics). On top of them, users can create their custom scenarios and explore a design space with simplicity.

First, don't forget to `pip install inductiva` and then you can follow the [install instructions](INSTALL.md) for this repository to get started.

The **Inductiva API** guide for SPH simulations is the following:
- [Running a simulation](SPH_SIMULATIONS.md#running-a-simulation);
- [Create a custom simulation scenario](scenario/README.md);
- [Generate a synthetic dataset at scale](scenario/DATASET.md).

In this tour, you will learn how to integrate **Inductiva API**  SPH simulation workflows through several examples.

To learn more about the `inductiva` package, check the [Inductiva API documentation](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/wiki).
