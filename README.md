With [**Inductiva API**](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/tree/main), exploring Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations was never easier. 

Users can launch the simulations they are familiar with through a simple Python interface,
without having to worry about downloading/compiling and installing simulation packages and
managing/maintaining computational resources.

Two open-source SPH simulators are available via **Inductiva API** -
[SplishSplash](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/wiki/SPlisHSPlasH) and
[DualSPHysics](https://github.com/inductiva/inductiva/wiki/DualSPHysics). Users
can use them directly or leverage the API to create custom scenarios and explore
design spaces with simplicity.

The **Inductiva API** tour for SPH simulations is the following:
- [How to use this repository and install any dependencies](INSTALL.md);
- [Run a simulation using straightforward API calls](SPH_SIMULATIONS.md#running-a-simulation);
- [Leverage the API to create a custom simulation scenario](FLUID_BLOCK.md);
- [Generate a synthetic dataset at scale](DATASET.md).
